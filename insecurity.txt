Insecurity in Ongata-Rongai has been a growing concern for the local residents. The Maasai-lodge, which is located in the area, has been particularly targeted by criminals. As a result, there have been calls for security beef-up and an increased police presence.

In addition to the security issues, there are reports of police laxity when it comes to responding to crime reports. This lack of action on the part of law enforcement has only exacerbated the situation and made it even more difficult for people living in Ongata-Rongai to feel safe.

It is clear that something needs to be done about this wanton insecurity in Ongata-Rongai if people are going to feel safe and secure again. Just the other week, Hon. Basil Omondi was the target of criminals in the area. He was attacked and injured in addition to losing his valuables.
